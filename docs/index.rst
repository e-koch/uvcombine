uvcombine
=========

Tools for combining single-dish and interferometric data.

uvcombine implements a similar approach to CASA's feather task but with additional options.
Also included are consistency tests for the flux calibration and single-dish scale by comparing
the data in the uv-overlap range.

Additional examples of the uvcombine functionality can be found in the
`examples <https://github.com/uvcombine/uvcombine/tree/master/examples>`_ directory.
