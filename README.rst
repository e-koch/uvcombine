uvcombine
=========

uvcombine provides tools for combining high-resolution images with missing large angular scales (Fourier-domain short-spacings)
with low-resolution images containing the short/zero spacing, including:

* Feathering two images
* Feathering two cubes (including for large cubes using spectral-cube's dask implementation)
* uv-overlap consistency tests and measuring the single dish flux scaling factor.

See the `documentation <https://uvcombine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information.

Worked notebook examples of the uvcombine functionality can be found in the `examples <https://github.com/uvcombine/uvcombine/tree/master/examples>`_ directory.
